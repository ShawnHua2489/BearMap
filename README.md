# BearMap
BearMaps is a Google Maps inspired clone for the vicinity of the UC Berkeley campus. The "smart" features of the application I implemented include map dragging/zooming, map rasterization, and A* search algorithm between two points)

This is a project from UC Berkeley's CS61B Data Structures course.
